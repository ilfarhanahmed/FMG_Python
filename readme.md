# FMG_Python: FortiManager Automation Toolkit

Welcome to **FMG_Python**! This is a personal project dedicated to mastering the **Python** programming language while building practical automation solutions for **Fortinet's FortiManager (FMG)**.

The primary goal of this repository is to transition manual FortiManager administrative tasks into efficient, code-driven workflows using the FMG JSON-RPC API.



## 🎯 Project Goals

* **Python Mastery**: Applying core Python concepts—such as REST APIs, JSON data structures, environment variables, and asynchronous task polling—to real-world networking scenarios.
* **FMG Automation**: Solving complex administrative challenges, including ADOM lifecycle management, sequential version upgrades, and database diagnostics.
* **Professional Workflow**: Implementing industry-standard development habits, such as credential masking and version control best practices.


## 🚀 Future Roadmap

This repository is a "living project" and will continue to grow as I expand my Python skills.
